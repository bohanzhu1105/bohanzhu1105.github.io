The website is created by Bohan Zhu using R markdown. Website contains a 
main page, an about page, and a graphical analysis of `rest_inspect` data 
which refers to New York City Restaurant Inspection Results.

For the `rest_inspect`, I created three plot.

First box plot indicates compares restaurant inspection scores across different cuisine type in Queens.

Second scatter plot maps the geographic distribution of inspections in Manhattan, with color indicating score levels.

Finally, the plot  summarizes the overall grade distribution across Brooklyn, showing that most restaurants received an “A” rating.
